	// Captain
	"<p>The <strong>Captain</strong> makes the most important decisions on the ship. He's also the only one who can see the 4 basic resources: crew, gold, wood, treasure.</p>\
    <p>His most important decision is whether to fight ( = fire all the cannons). He can also discover new islands, trade resources with a dock, and more.</p>\
    <p>The captain is the only role that can't be upgraded</p>",

    // First Mate
    "<p>The <strong>First Mate</strong> steers the ship by rotating the compass towards the desired direction.</p>\
    <p>The ship in the background reminds you of last turn's orientation.</p>\
    <p>At the start, you can't rotate the compass. By upgrading, you get more freedom of movement. The red circle indicates angles you can NOT choose.</p>",

    // Cartographer
	"<p>The <strong>Cartographer</strong> is the only one who can read the map (and has to find out where the ship is)</p>\
	<p>By sliding/dragging your finger, you can move around the map.</p>\
	<p>At the start, you can only see a small area around you. By upgrading, your sight improves: you can see further and get more details about surrounding units.</p>\
	<p>TIP: Constantly tell the others what's happening. The First Mate and Sailor cannot sail blind - they depend on you!</p>",

	// Sailor
	"<p>The <strong>Sailor</strong> determines the speed of the ship. He can adjust the sails or make crew row the boat.</p>\
	<p>Adjusting the sails is a one-time action: you spend X crew to quickly change the sail.</p>\
	<p>Rowing is continuous: once you spend X crew on rowing, they will keep rowing until you tell them to stop.</p>\
	<p>At the start, the ship has a small maximum speed and maximum change (acceleration/deceleration). By upgrading, you can raise this ceiling.</p>"
