# In the Same Boat

"In the same boat" is a party game for (large) groups where you need to control a pirate ship together. 

The game is started on a computer screen. Then, players can connect to the game with their smartphones. Once everyone is connected, the game starts.

Everyone is placed on a ship, together with 2 to 4 other players. Each one of you gets a different role (or set of roles): you might be the captain, while the player next to you steers the ship, and another player across the table has to load the cannons.

You'll need to explore the world map, battle sea monsters, upgrade your equipment, trade resources, find treasures, and ultimately destroy the other player's ships.

Work together to keep your ship alive, your resources stocked, your cannons loaded, and your crew working hard!

The last ship standing wins the game.

(In more complex variants, there are more roles and more ways to win the game.)
