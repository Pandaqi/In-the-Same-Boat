When testing the game locally, I need to change a few parameters to make it work well.

When deploying the game, these need to be changed back.



1) Set the SERVER_IP (in serverInfo) to the actual server 				(instead of localhost)

2) Set "prepSkip" variable (on new rooms) to FALSE 						(it skips the preparation, which is useful in debugging, but not allowed in the real game)

3) Build the app ourselves!

4) Remove the "build" script from the WebPack							(it never ends, because nodemon watches the files)


For FINAL deployment:

1) Re-enable the ROOM ID system 										(for unique room ids, instead of always "SHIP")

2) Uglify/minify JS again 												(by enabling the WebPack plugin in webpack.config)
