When testing the game locally, I need to change a few parameters to make it work well.

When deploying the game, these need to be changed back.


1) Re-enable the ROOM ID system (for unique room ids, instead of always "SHIP")

2) Set the SERVER_IP (in serverInfo) to the actual server (instead of localhost)

3) Uglify/minify JS again (by enabling the WebPack plugin in webpack.config)
